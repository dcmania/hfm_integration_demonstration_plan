# HFM Integration and Demonstration Functional Area Q3 FY18 - Q4 FY20 Plan
## Planning Team Members
* Michael Lawson (NREL, Planning  Lead)
* David Maniaci (SNL)
* Myra Blaylock (SNL)

## Other Team Members
* Sreyas Ananthan (NREL)
* Matt Barone (SNL)

## FY20 Target Use Case
* Actuator line simulation of wind farm
* Blade resolved two turbine simulation

## Tasks
1. Development and verification of actuator line simulation capabilities (Dave)
2. Actuator line wind farm demonstration (Myra)
3. Blade resolved simulations (Mike L)

## Dependencies between the tasks and other functional areas
* (1) Further McAlester blade and wing V&V work to better understand the computational requirements of blade resolved modeling
* Validation and demonstration of hybrid RANS-LES simulations that are needed to perform blade resolved turbine simulations in realistic atmospheric conditions.
* Demonstration and preliminary validation of utility scale turbine simulation. This work will hopefully be performed using the Siemens 2.3, pending the availability of data, geometry, etc. (1.5 FTE year)
* (2) Developing and demonstrating methodology to integrate overset capabilities for full turbine simulations (should be completed by Q4 2019) (6 FTE months) - Mike

## Publications
* One or more publication on the work verifying actuator line simulation capabilities and simulating a full wind farm by Q2 FY20
* One publication on two-turbine blade resolved simulations by Q4 FY20
* Conference papers and/or presentations as appropriate
