## HFM Integration and Demonstration FY20 Objective
The overall goal of this task is to demonstrate wind farm and wind turbine simulations at a level of fidelity that is needed to advance the scientific understanding of wind plant physics. In order to accomplish this objective, Nalu will need to have the ability to (1) model large wind farms using actuator line models and (2) model two or more blade-resolved turbines with wake interactions using hybrid RANS-LES.

## FY20 Target Use Case
* Actuator line simulation of wind farm
* Blade resolved two turbine simulation

## Tasks
1. Development and verification of actuator line simulation capabilities (Dave)
2. Actuator line wind farm demonstration (Myra)
3. Blade resolved simulations (Mike L)

## Dependencies between the tasks and other functional areas
* (1) Further McAlester blade and wing V&V work to better understand the computational requirements of blade resolved modeling
* Validation and demonstration of hybrid RANS-LES simulations that are needed to perform blade resolved turbine simulations in realistic atmospheric conditions.
* Demonstration and preliminary validation of utility scale turbine simulation. This work will hopefully be performed using the Siemens 2.3, pending the availability of data, geometry, etc. (1.5 FTE year)
* (2) Developing and demonstrating methodology to integrate overset capabilities for full turbine simulations (should be completed by Q4 2019) (6 FTE months) - Mike
