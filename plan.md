# HFM Integration and Demonstration Functional Area Q3 FY18 - Q4 FY20 Plan
## Planning Team Members
* Michael Lawson (NREL, Planning  Lead)
* David Maniaci (SNL)
* Myra Blaylock (SNL)

## Other Team Members
* Sreyas Ananthan (NREL)
* Matt Barone (SNL)


## FY20 Target Use Case
Run the 2 turbine case with wake impingement, publish a paper based on the runs, release all information to the public that is needed to run this case.

## Tasks
* Further **McAlester blade and wing V&V work** to better understand the computational requirements of blade resolved modeling (9 FTE-months)
* **Validation and demonstration of hybrid RANS-LES** simulations that are needed to perform blade resolved turbine simulations in realistic atmospheric conditions. (9 FTE months)
* Demonstration and preliminary validation of **utility scale turbine simulation**. This work will hopefully be performed using the Siemens 2.3, pending the availability of data, geometry, etc. (1.5 FTE year)
* Developing and demonstrating methodology to integrate **overset capabilities** for full turbine simulations (should be completed by Q4 2019) (6 FTE months)
* Demonstrate **two turbine simulation with wake impingement** using the Siemens 2.3, if available. (1.5 FT year)

## Dependencies between the tasks and other functional areas
Myra, Dave, and Mike to discuss on 23 April 2018 call.

## Resources (particular individuals, FTE amounts, compute-time resources) needed
* 5 FTE years between Q3 FY18 and Q4 FY20
* Computational time estimate is needed. Myra, Dave and Mike to discuss 23 April 2018 call. 

## Key credibility assertion steps that need to be executed
See the tasks section.

## Intermediary use cases, validation cases, and calibration data needs
See the tasks section.

## Publications
* One publication or presentation for each tasks
* Two journal publications submitted by Q4 FY20
* Three conference papers and/or presentations by Q4 FY20
